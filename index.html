    <p>Hi! I'm Rosie, Welcome to my Portfolio</p>
    <p>Here we will be exploring what I've learned at Epicodus so far, all while introducing and sharing a bit about myself.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a 32 year old trans non-binary person residing in the PNW. Originally from the Sunshine State (Florida) I moved to Portland, OR in January 2014.
